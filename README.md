Link2QR
=======

Google Chrome extension that adds a menu item to the Context Meny when you right click on a Link or Image.  Allows you to create a QR code of said Link or Image URL.

Made possible with the following JavaScript librarys:
 * Javascript QR Code Generater: http://www.d-project.com/qrcode/index.html
 * jquery.qrcode.js: http://jeromeetienne.github.com/jquery-qrcode/


# How to get it
You can get the latest version [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dx3lp7mxgzunqh8/Link2QR.crx).

# How to install
Since I have not put it in the Chrome Store yet, you can't install it from the link.  Once the download it complete, open the Extension page by going to Toos/Extensions.  Then drage and drop the Link2QR.crx file into the extension page.  When it asks if you want to install it click Yes.
