Link2QR
=======

Google Chrome extension that adds a menu item to the Context Meny when you right click on a Link or Image.  Allows you to create a QR code of said Link or Image URL.

Made possible with the following JavaScript librarys:
 * Javascript QR Code Generator: http://d-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/qrcode/index.html
 * jquery.qrcode.js: http://jeromeetienne.github.com/jquery-qrcode/


## How to get it
You can get the latest version [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dx3lp7mxgzunqh8/Link2QR.crx).

## How to install
Since I have not put it in the Chrome Store yet, you can't install it from the link.  Once the download it complete, open the Extension page by going to Toos/Extensions.  Then drage and drop the Link2QR.crx file into the extension page.  When it asks if you want to install it click Yes.

## Why?
Well, the idea came to me when I was trying to get some new wallpapers on my iPhone from imgur.  Someone had posted a gallery of over 200 wallpapers, and I wanted to get a few.  But how was I going to get them onto my phone?  I could copy the source urls and e-mail them to my self, or I could just download them one by one and transfer them over using iTunes.  Or I could brows to gallery using my phone and then go through them one by one, but again how to get the gallery URL to my phone?  There just wasn't a simple, one step way of doing this.  So I thought...why not use a QR code?  I could just use an app already on my phone to scan it, and it would load in the web browser for me, all in one shot!

So I created a simple extension, where it adds a new menu item to the context menu when you right click on a link or image.  Click it and a popup comes up with the QR generated for you, all in JavaScript!
